  <p><p><style="margin-top:40px;">Before the start, let me introduce myself a bit. Just a simple, basic thing you know. My name is Sumin Woo and my English name is Woodie. Have you watched Toy Story? One of the main character's name is Woodie which is my favorite one. I am 24 years old, well it is actually 22 in international age. I was born in 1996! Remember my birthday which is 12th of August. Now I live in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. I have lived in Thailand for one and half year. I've also lived in Germany for half year. I am KyungHee University student but I will graduate next month. My major is Business Administration. In the future, I really want to be a great CEO. Running business is my dream of life and the purpose as well.</p></p>
