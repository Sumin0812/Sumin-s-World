  <p><p><style="margin-top:500px;">This is baby Sumin who was less than two year. Oh, I had pretty big eyes at that time! My mother said I was very sensitive, talkative and also curious too much for everything. So I always asked a lot until my mother felt annoying. Hahahahahaha</p></p>

  <p><p><style="margin-top:500px;">I had a brother who is younger than me five years. When I was a child, I always played with my brother and he quite followed me a lot. We liked to play with Lego or just go out side and do some adventure thing.</p></p>
